      <p class="page-text mb-5 mt-2">Yoga began to gain popularity in the West at the end of the 19th century. But it was a yoga deeply influenced by Western
      spiritual and religious ideas, representing in many respects a radical break from the grass-roots yoga lineages of
      India. The first wave of “export yogis,” headed by Swami Vivekananda, largely ignored asana and tended to focus instead
      on pranayama, meditation, and positive thinking. The English-educated Vivekananda arrived on American shores in 1893 and
      was an instant success with the high society of the East Coast. </p>

      <p class="page-text mb-5 mt-2">Weather is something everybody deals with, and accurate data of it like what is coming can help users to make inform
      decisions. With weather apps for iOS and Android, people can exactly know when to expect a change in the weather
      conditions. Weather apps can give urgent alerts too.
      <br />
      Undoubtedly, weather forecasting has come a long way, helping people to know about weather conditions. So, if you are in
      an area where weather frequently changes from sunny to torrential rain in a matter of minutes, then what is the easiest
      way to make sure to be prepared for. A suitable answer is a weather application.</p>

      <p class="mb-5 mt-2">Yogurt has been a part of the human diet for several millennia and goes by many names throughout the world. The word
      “yogurt” is believed to have come from the Turkish word “yoğurmak,” which means to thicken, coagulate, or curdle. While
      references to the health-promoting properties of yogurt date back to 6000 BC in Indian Ayurvedic scripts, it was not
      until the 20th century that Stamen Grigorov, a Bulgarian medical student, attributed the benefits to lactic acid
      bacteria. Today, most yogurt is fermented milk that is acidified with viable and well-defined bacteria (Lactobacillus
      bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophiles). While patterns of yogurt consumption vary greatly from country to country,
      consumption is generally low. In the United States and Brazil, for example, only 6% of the population consume yogurt on
      a daily basis. Low consumption of yogurt represents a missed opportunity to contribute to a healthy lifestyle, as yogurt
      provides a good to excellent source of highly bioavailable protein and an excellent source of calcium as well as a
      source of probiotics that may provide a range of health benefits.</p>
